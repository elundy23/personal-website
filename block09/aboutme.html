    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Page, my name is Paul Lundy. I am a working professional. I have developed this website to give you some pernal info about me. 
        I am from Norcross, Ga, and I attended Georgia State University where I earned a degree in Economics. After graduation 
        I started working as Customer Service Representative fro State Farm. I was then promoted to an Underwriting Service Assistant and then later promoter to an Underwriter. Through my career and time in school
        I always had an interest in We Devlopment and Coding. I have taken a few courses in College but never fully commited. I began 
        working part time at Amazon and they were offering a course in Full Stack Academy. With completion of this course I hope to move into a Web Development role. </p>
